# 👋 Darshil Dave — AI/ML Engineer 
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a hands-on developer with a passion for building intelligent systems — from LLM-powered chatbots and real-time vision robots to full-stack apps and enterprise cloud pipelines. I specialize in Python, Flask, Azure, Hugging Face, and vector databases, with experience across the full AI lifecycle: data ingestion, model development, backend integration, and UI/UX delivery.
